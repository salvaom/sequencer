def collect(iterable, collection_regex=None, minimum_instances=2):
    '''From either an iterable or a file path, attempts to detect all sequenced
    elements within the list and returns them as a
    :obj:`~sequencer.sequence.Sequence` object.

    Example:

        >>> import sequencer
        >>> sequences, extra = sequencer.collect('test/resources/seq_01')
        >>> sequences
        [<sequencer.sequence.Sequence "weta%02d.jpg" [1-18]>]
        >>> sequences[0].start(), sequences[0].end()
        (1, 18)

    Args:
        iterable (:obj:`iter`, :obj:`str`): Iterable to detect sequenced
            elements in. If a file path is passed as the argument, it will
            use `os.listdir` of that path as the element list.
        collection_regex (:obj:`str`, optional): If set, it will use the given
            regular expression to detect sequences in an iterable.

            .. warning::

                The regular expression **must** contain the following keys:
                ``name``, ``number``, ``tail`` and ``ext``

        minimum_instances (:obj:`int`, optional): Minimum number of matches in
            an element to be consider a sequence. Defaults to 2.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple with a list of all sequences found in the first index
        and a list of all files non-sequence related in the second index.

        Sequences are instances of :obj:`sequencer.sequence.Sequence` and the
        extra files are :obj:`str`
